# vconcat
Quick and dirty node.js hack that embeds subtitles then resizes and concatenates videos generated by the [AutoBoy Dash Cam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.happyconz.blackbox&amp;hl=en) Android app. Could work with `.mp4` and `.srt` files coming from other sources though.

Subtitles (if present) are first (sort of) converted to Advanced Substation Alpha format (which uses the aptly named `.ass` extension) via a very, very, **VERY** stupid and dirty algorithm and mainly for presentation purposes. There is no parsing whatsoever, just bits and pieces shuffled around.

## Requirements
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) executable in path
- [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) for terminal string styling: `npm -i -g chalk`

## Usage

Optionally link the script with a shorter name to a folder in your PATH:

```bash
cd /path/to/script/
ln -s ./vconcat.js /usr/local/bin/vconcat
```
then run it:

```bash
vconcat "/path/to/source/folder" [scale [path/to/destination/folder]]
```

### Params:
- `/path/to/source/folder` - mandatory: a folder where files generated by AutoBoy Dash Cam app are stored (`.mp4` and `.srt` files); enclose it in quotes if any of the folder names contains spaces or other atypical characters
- `scale` - optional: resize videos using this floating point number; it defaults to .25 (meaning 25%) if omited
- `path/to/destination/folder` - optional: a folder where processed files are to be stored; it defaults to the source folder if omited

## Caveats:
The script makes *a lot* of assumptions regarding, among other things, file names, date and subtitle formats, so it is probably very frail. It works for me, sorry `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`.

It also contains a half-assed stab at a progress bar ðŸ™ƒ.

## Motivation
I'm using a donated Samsung A5 (2014) with the AutoBoy app as a dash cam. I'm archiving the recordings of most of the trips when my five year old daughter was in the car because she says lots of funny things and because I'm a melancholic old fartâ€¦  maybe I'll even listen to them sometime in the coming years, you never know.

Anyway, the really important part is the audio track, but I felt that also keeping the video would provide a little more context to the sound. The subtitles also contain additional metadata such as date, time, speed and GPS coordinates. Storing them "as is" seemed a waste of space, so I settled on resizing the videos to Â¼ of the original resolution. The sound is not touched.
